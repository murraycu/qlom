Qlom

A Qt application to view Glom databases, using libglom, the non-UI component
of Glom.


Qlom currently only works with
- A centrally-hosted PostgreSQL database, such as one created by Glom.
  That means, one that will still be hosted by PostgreSQL even when Glom is 
  not running.
- A sqlite database, such as the one in Glom's git checkout. For instance:
    $ qlom /home/murrayc/checkouts/gnome30/glom/examples/sqlite/test_sqlite_music/test_sqlite_music.glom 
  (A patch would be welcome to make that accept a relative file path.)

However, it wouldn't be too hard to make Qlom start the PostgreSQL instance 
when necessary. There is libglom API for that.

Qlom uses Autotroll in its build system:

Build:

Here are some hints to fix build problems that really should not happen. 
Patches to fix these problems properly would be appreciated.

* The autogen.sh script uses autoreconf but you might need to do this first when 
building from git:
  $ export ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.11
  $ export AUTOMAKE=automake-1.11
to avoid these errors:
configure.ac:29: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR
configure.ac:46: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_DEFINE
(Just requiring 1.11 in AM_AUTOMAKE_INIT() does not solve this.)

* You might also need to remove your qt3 -dev package so that autotroll 
correctly finds qt4. For instance, remove libqt3-mt-dev on Ubuntu or Debian.
