Build:

Here are some hints to fix build problems that really should not happen. 
Patches to fix these problems properly would be appreciated.

* The autogen.sh script uses autoreconf but you might need to do this first when 
building from git:
  export ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.11
  export AUTOMAKE=automake-1.11
to avoid these errors:
configure.ac:29: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR
configure.ac:46: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_DEFINE
(Just requiring 1.11 in AM_AUTOMAKE_INIT() does not solve this.)

* You might also need to remove your qt3 -dev package so that autotroll 
correctly finds qt4. For instance, remove libqt3-mt-dev on Ubuntu or Debian.
